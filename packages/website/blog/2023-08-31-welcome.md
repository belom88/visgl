Hello, everyone!

I'm Viktor.

I'd like to share my work here. Recently I've published [VehicleLayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@belom88/vehicle-layer). It is a deck.gl layer that is developed to put vehicles on a map. Feel free to use it! I'll be glad to receive any feedback. If you have some troubles let me know with creating a [GitHUB issue](https://github.com/belom88/visgl-addons/issues).
